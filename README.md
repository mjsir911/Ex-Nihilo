# Ex-Nihilo

**Ex Nihilo** is an open source software library for procedurally generating star systems and the planets inside using randomly generated seeds or a user-defined seed. 

## Note
Right now, there is no currently stable version to run. Visit the [experimental](https://github.com/mjsir911/Ex-Nihilo/tree/experimental) branch or the [revamped](https://github.com/mjsir911/Ex-Nihilo/tree/revamped) branch for some more up-to date (but more broken) work.
