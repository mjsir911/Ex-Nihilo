# Ex-Nihilo

**Ex Nihilo** is an open source software library for procedurally generating star systems and the planets inside using randomly generated seeds or a user-defined seed. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

To run the scripts, [Blender](www.blender.org) has to be installed and working properly. Extremely minimal knowledge in blender is required to get scripts up and running.

### Installing

To procure a running developmental environment, clone the latest stable branch from the git repository.

Once the git repository has been cloned and located, and blender has been installed, you must run blender to automatically run a python file ([launchblend.py](src/launchblend.py)). This is typically done with the blender command, but depending on your software may be subject to change

```
blender -P /path/to/repo/src/launchblend.py
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
